# Hangman

The "Hangman Game in Python" is a text-based implementation of the classic word guessing game, Hangman. The program allows players to guess letters of a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game incorporates interactive input/output and provides feedback on the player's progress.

- Key Features:

| Word Selection: The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, such as "python," "java," "swift," or "javascript."

| Masked Word Display: The chosen word is displayed as a series of dashes, with guessed letters revealed while keeping the rest masked.

| Attempts Counter: Players have a limited number of attempts (8 by default) to guess the word correctly.

| Letter Guessing: Players input a single lowercase letter to guess the word's letters.

| Win/Loss Tracking: The program records and displays the number of wins and losses for each play session.

- Technologies Used:

Python: The entire game is developed in Python, using basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.
